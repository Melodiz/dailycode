The provided text is a problem statement for a competitive programming task titled "DActive Learning." It involves an interactive task where predictions are made iteratively, and feedback is received to improve the model. Here's a structured breakdown of the problem statement:

1. **Problem Name**: Active Learning

2. **Constraints**:
   - Time Limit: 30 seconds
   - Memory Limit: 256.0 MB

3. **Input/Output**:
   - Input is provided via standard input or a file named `input.txt`.
   - Output should be written to standard output or a file named `output.txt`.

4. **Task Description**:
   - Kesha has been tasked with solving a business problem using machine learning to increase user happiness.
   - There is an ancient service that can measure happiness for a fixed set of users, but its internal workings are unknown.
   - Kesha has a dataset of users with features that he intends to use for his model.
   - For each user, Kesha can make a prediction and receive the derivative of an unknown loss function.

5. **Input Format**:
   - The first line contains three integers: `N` (500 <= N <= 1000), `k` (10 <= k <= 20), and `t` (10 <= t <= 100), representing the number of objects in the dataset, the number of features, and the number of iterations, respectively.
   - Each of the next `N` lines contains `k` numbers, representing the feature description of each object in the dataset.

6. **Output Format**:
   - There should be `t` iterations of output predictions for each object in the dataset.
   - Each iteration consists of `N` numbers, where the `i-th` number is the model's prediction for the `i-th` object.
   - After each of the first `t-1` iterations, a line containing `N` numbers is output, where the `i-th` number is the derivative of the unknown loss function for the `i-th` object at the given prediction point.
   - After the last iteration, no feedback is received. The predictions are used to measure the value of the unknown loss function.
   - The solution is considered correct if the loss value is below a certain threshold, indicating that the predictions closely approximate the target in terms of the loss function.
   - Remember to flush the output buffer after each line of predictions.

7. **Notes**:
   - The task is similar to gradient boosting, where the final model is a composition of base models, each approximating the negative gradient of the loss function at the point corresponding to the sum of predictions from previous iterations.

This problem requires iteratively making predictions and using feedback to adjust the model, similar to the process in gradient boosting. The goal is to minimize the loss function by the end of the iterations.
