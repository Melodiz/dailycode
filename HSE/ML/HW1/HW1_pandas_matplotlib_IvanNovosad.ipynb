        "The assignment consists of two sections on working with tabular data using the pandas library and visualization using matplotlib. In the first section you will have to perform basic tasks using the above libraries, and in the second section you will have to assign students to courses. Points are given for completing individual items. Tasks within a section are recommended to be solved in the order in which they are given in the assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assignment is aimed at mastering jupyter notebook (to be used in further assignments), pandas and matplotlib libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Assessment and penalties\n",
        "Each of the tasks has a certain “cost” (indicated in brackets near the task). The maximum allowable grade for a task is 10 points.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may not turn in an assignment after a strict deadline. In case of assigning an incomplete grade for a task due to errors, the reviewer has the opportunity to correct the work under the conditions specified in the response letter.\n",
        "\n",
        "The assignment is completed independently. “Similar” solutions are considered plagiarism and all students involved (including those who have been copied from) cannot receive more than 0 points for it. If you have found a solution to any of the assignments (or part of it) in an open source, you must provide a link to that source (most likely you will not be the only one who found it, so to exclude suspicion of plagiarism, a link to the source is required).\n",
        "\n",
        "If you used a generative model for finding a solution, you need to provide the link to the service used (browser version, tg bot, etc.), network name, the prompt(s) used and how you evaluate the performance of this model. Without this reflection the home assignment won't be graded.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Format of submission\n",
        "Assignments are submitted through the Smart LMS system (link will be in the telegram chat). You should send a notebook with the completed assignment. Name the notebook itself in the format **HW1-pandas-matplotlib-NameLastname.ipynb**, where Name and Lastname are your first and last name.\n",

        "For ease of checking yourself, calculate your maximum grade (based on the set of problems solved) and indicate it below.\n",

        "matplotlib of course has [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html) with lots of [examples](https://matplotlib.org/examples/), but it's enough to know about a few basic types of plots to get started:\n",

        "- `hist` - a histogram showing the distribution of some value;\n",

        "- the graph should have a name;\n",
        "- if several graphs are shown, an explanatory legend is necessary;\n",
        "- all lines on the graphs must be clearly visible (no similar colors or colors that merge with the background);\n",
        "- if a value with an obvious range of values is displayed (for example, percentages can be from 0 to 100), it is desirable to scale the axis to the entire range of values (the exception is when you need to show a small difference that is not noticeable at such scales);\n",
        "- the grid on the graph helps to estimate point values by eye, this is usually useful, so it is better to draw it;\n",
