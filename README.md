Greetings! I am a second-year student at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, specializing in Applied Mathematics and Informatics. 

I am eager to build a network with like-minded individuals who share a passion for this field. If you are in Moscow, I'd be delighted to meet up for a cup of coffee. Should you have any questions or wish to engage in a discussion, feel free to reach out to me on [Telegram](t.me/Mellodizzz).

Best of luck!
